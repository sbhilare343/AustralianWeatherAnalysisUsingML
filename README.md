# Evaluating Machine Learning Models on the Australian Weather Dataset

## Overview

In this project, we apply various machine learning algorithms to the Australian weather dataset to predict weather-related outcomes. The algorithms we will use are Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We will evaluate the performance of these models using several metrics, including Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R2-Score.

## Dataset

The Australian weather dataset contains daily weather observations from various locations in Australia. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, along with a target variable indicating whether it will rain the next day.

## Algorithms

### Linear Regression: 
A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
A classification algorithm that classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.
### Decision Trees: 
A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression that predicts the value of a target variable by learning decision rules from features.
### Logistic Regression:
A classification algorithm used to predict a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
### Support Vector Machines (SVM): 
A classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Accuracy Score: 
The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
### Jaccard Index:
A measure of similarity between two sets, calculated as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets.
### F1-Score: 
The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
### LogLoss:
A performance metric for classification models that measures the uncertainty of the predictions based on probability.
### Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 
The average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values.
### Mean Squared Error (MSE): 
The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
### R2-Score: 
The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Implementation
We will implement each algorithm, train the models using the training data, and evaluate their performance using the specified metrics. Finally, we will generate a report summarizing the results and insights from the models' performances.
